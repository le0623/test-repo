# Phase 2 Progress Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed in This Session

### 1. Comprehensive Audit
- Audited all Cloud API endpoints (~100+ methods)
- Audited all Enterprise API endpoints (~30 methods)
- Created detailed coverage report in PHASE_2_AUDIT.md
- Identified critical missing commands

### 2. Implemented Critical Cloud Commands

#### VPC Peering (`cloud peering`)
- `list` - List all VPC peerings for a subscription
- `show` - Show peering details
- `create` - Create new VPC peering connection
- `delete` - Delete peering (with --force confirmation)

#### Transit Gateway (`cloud transit-gateway`)
- `list` - List Transit Gateway attachments
- `show` - Show attachment details
- `create` - Create new TGW attachment
- `delete` - Delete attachment (with --force confirmation)

#### Backups (`cloud backup`)
- `list` - List database backups
- `show` - Show backup details
- `create` - Create new backup
- `restore` - Restore from backup
- `delete` - Delete backup (with --force confirmation)

#### ACLs (`cloud acl`)
- `list` - List ACL rules for a database
- `show` - Show ACL rule details
- `create` - Create new ACL rule
- `update` - Update existing ACL rule
- `delete` - Delete ACL rule (with --force confirmation)

#### CRDB Active-Active (`cloud crdb`)
- `list` - List all Active-Active databases
- `show` - Show CRDB details
- `create` - Create new Active-Active database
- `update` - Update CRDB configuration
- `delete` - Delete CRDB (with --force confirmation)
- `add-region` - Add region to CRDB
- `remove-region` - Remove region from CRDB

## üìä Coverage Improvement

### Before Phase 2
- **Cloud API**: ~15% coverage (15 of 100+ methods)
- **Enterprise API**: ~50% coverage (15 of 30 methods)

### After Phase 2 (So Far)
- **Cloud API**: ~40% coverage (40+ of 100+ methods) ‚úÖ **+25%**
- **Enterprise API**: ~50% coverage (unchanged, focus was on Cloud)

## üéØ Key Features Added

1. **Consistent --force Flag**: All destructive operations now require `--force` or show confirmation prompt
2. **Proper Parameter Structure**: All commands use proper typed parameters
3. **Output Format Support**: All commands work with `--output json/yaml/table`
4. **JMESPath Queries**: All commands support `--query` for filtering output
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and validation

## üìù Still TODO for Phase 2

### High Priority
- [ ] API Keys management
- [ ] Metrics commands
- [ ] Logs commands
- [ ] Fixed/Flexible plan commands
- [ ] Private Service Connect commands

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Cloud Accounts (different from Account)
- [ ] Enhance existing commands with more options
- [ ] Add --wait flag for async operations
- [ ] Add progress indicators

### Low Priority
- [ ] Improve error messages with suggestions
- [ ] Add --dry-run support
- [ ] Add shell completion support

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Continue implementing remaining high-priority commands
2. Add integration tests for new commands
3. Update documentation with new command examples
4. Consider creating a PR for Phase 2 work so far
5. Begin planning Phase 3 (Workflow Commands)

## üí° Notes

- The new commands follow the existing patterns for consistency
- All API endpoints are accessed using the raw API client methods
- Force confirmations prevent accidental deletions
- The architecture is ready for Phase 3 workflow commands
